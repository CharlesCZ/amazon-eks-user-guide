# Launching self\-managed Bottlerocket nodes<a name="launch-node-bottlerocket"></a>

For most cases, we recommend launching managed Bottlerocket nodes instead of a self\-managed Bottlerocket nodes\. For more information, see [Launch template support](managed-node-groups.md)\. If you want to deploy a self\-managed node group using a custom AMI, then see [Building Bottlerocket](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/BUILDING.md) on GitHub and [Custom AMI support](https://eksctl.io/usage/custom-ami-support/) in the `eksctl` documentation\.
