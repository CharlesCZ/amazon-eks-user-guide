# Integrating AWS Secrets Manager secrets with the Kubernetes Secrets Store<a name="manage-secrets"></a>

Kubernetes provides a key/value store, `etcd`, that allows you to create key/value pairs and make them available to applications running in containers or pods through a file system interface\. The Kubernetes community offers a Secret Store Container Storage Interface \(CSI\) driver that you can use to provide secrets using the same standard file system interface\. For more information, see [Kubernetes Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver#kubernetes-secrets-store-csi-driver) on GitHub\. The driver uses a plugable interface that allows secrets providers, such as AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Parameter Store, to write adapter plugins to get secrets from the given provider, rather than from the standard Kubernetes `etcd` store\.

The AWS Secrets Manager and Configuration Provider \(ASCP\) is a plugin for the industry\-standard Kubernetes Secrets Store Container Storage Interface \(CSI\) driver used for providing secrets to applications operating on Amazon EKS\. You can use ASCP to provide compatibility for legacy Kubernetes workloads that received secrets through the file system or Kubernetes `etcd`\. You can securely store and manage your secrets in Secrets Manager, as well as retrieve them through your application workloads running on Kubernetes\. You can also use IAM and resource policies for your secret, to limit and restrict access to specific Kubernetes pods inside a cluster\. The policies control accessibility to secrets by an individual pod\. 

ASCP can use the optional rotation reconciler component to ensure retrieval of the latest secret from the secret provider\. With the rotation reconciler enabled, ASCP ensures that your applications always receive the latest version of the secret, enabling you to benefit from the lifecycle management capabilities of Secrets Manager\.
